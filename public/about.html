<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer passionate about building innovative and AI-powered solutions. Right now, I'm working on an all-in-one real estate rental platform that uses AI for property recommendations, tenant screening, fraud detection, virtual tours, and predictive market analytics.</p>

<p>I work with MySQL for data storage and use Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE. I prefer Mercurial over Git for version control and develop on a Windows system.</p>

<p>I'm always looking to improve my skills and stay up to date with industry trends, ensuring that my projects are efficient, user-friendly, and scalable.</p>
